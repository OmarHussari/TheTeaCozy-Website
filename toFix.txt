Stuff to fix in The Tea Cozy

1. -DRY especially (textContainer) and (textContainerr), and avoid calling flex on both parents and childs-
2. Fix the non responsive Mission and Featured Tea statements
3. Make sure fonts and font sizes for h1, h2, etc. are all the same as redline
4. Add some media queries to make it responsive with Phones, don't forget the meta tag in HTML (Featured Tea imgs and Locations fonts)
5. Set local links to move exactly to the desired destination, (not below it due to the fixed header)
7. Make a git repository for the project and push it via Command Line.
